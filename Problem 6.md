## P6:
For the same table in P4, find the title of the bug with token = "token660" and reported_at on "2020-08-30":
This problem is graded partially, 10% on correctness (your query gets the correct count) and 90% on performance (your query makes use of available indexes).

## My Solution:
SELECT title AS title <br/>
FROM bugs<br/>
WHERE token='token660' and reported_at='2020-08-30';

## Accepted Solution!!
## Score: 10% :(
